# Charityledger: Trustless Donation Tracking

## 🏷️ Project Title
**Charityledger: Trustless Donation Tracking**

## 📖 Project Description
Charityledger is a blockchain-based donation tracking system designed to bring **transparency, accountability, and trust** to charitable contributions. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, donors can send funds directly to charities without intermediaries. Every transaction is recorded on-chain, ensuring that donation history remains immutable and verifiable.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To build a **fully transparent and decentralized ecosystem** for charitable giving where donors can confidently contribute, track their impact, and hold organizations accountable — all without relying on third parties.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Transparent Donations:** Every donation is publicly visible on the blockchain.
- **Trustless Tracking:** No intermediaries—donations go directly from donors to the charity wallet.
- **Immutable Records:** Donation data is permanently stored and verifiable on-chain.
- **Owner-Controlled Withdrawals:** Only the designated charity owner can withdraw collected funds.
- **Event Logging:** All transactions are logged using blockchain events for easy tracking.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Multi-Charity Support:** Enable multiple verified charities to operate within one smart contract.
- **Decentralized Governance:** Allow donors to vote on fund allocations or new charity onboarding.
- **Automated Fund Distribution:** Smart contract-based allocation of funds to specific causes.
- **Cross-Chain Expansion:** Deploy on other blockchains like Polygon or Binance Smart Chain for lower gas fees.
- **Integration with NFTs:** Reward donors with blockchain-based proof-of-donation NFTs.

## 🧩 Technology Stack
- **Solidity (v0.8.x)**
- **Hardhat / Truffle**
- **Ethereum Blockchain**
- **Ethers.js / Web3.js (for frontend interaction)**
